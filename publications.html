										title="<strong>Beyond Signatures: Leveraging Sensor Fusion for Contextual Handwriting Recognition</strong><br/><br/>
												This paper deals with biometric identification based on unique patterns and characteristics of an individual's handwriting, focusing on the dynamic writing process on a touchscreen device. Related work in this domain indicates the dominance of specific research approaches. Namely, in most cases, only the signature is analyzed, verification methods are more prevalent than recognition methods, and the provided solutions are mainly based on using a particular device or specific sensor for collecting biometric data. In this context, our work aims to fill the identified research gap by introducing a new handwriting-based user recognition technique. The proposed approach implements the concept of sensor fusion and does not rely exclusively on signatures for recognition but also includes other forms of handwriting, such as short sentences, words, or individual letters. Additionally, two different ways of handwriting input, using a stylus and a finger, are introduced into the analysis. In order to collect data on the dynamics of handwriting and signing, a specially designed apparatus was used with various sensors integrated into common smart devices, along with additional external sensors and accessories. A total of 60 participants took part in a controlled experiment to form a handwriting biometrics dataset for further analysis. To classify participants' handwriting, custom architecture CNN models were utilized for feature extraction and classification tasks. The obtained results showed that the proposed handwriting recognition system achieves accuracies of 0.982, 0.927, 0.884, and 0.661 for signatures, words, short sentences, and individual letters, respectively. We further investigated the main effects of the input modality and the train set’s size on the system's accuracy. Finally, an ablation study was carried out to analyze the impact of individual sensors within the fusion-based setup.">

										title="<strong>Enhancing Biophysical Muscle Fatigue Model in the Dynamic Context of Soccer</strong><br/><br/>
												In the field of muscle fatigue models (MFMs), the prior research has demonstrated success in fitting data in specific contexts, but it falls short in addressing the diverse efforts and rapid changes in exertion typical of soccer matches. This study builds upon the existing model, aiming to enhance its applicability and robustness to dynamic demand shifts. The objective is to encapsulate the complexities of soccer dynamics with a streamlined set of parameters. Our refined model achieved a slight improvement in the R<sup>2</sup> score in the maximum hand-grip test, increasing from 0.87 to 0.89 compared to the existing model. It also demonstrated dynamic change robustness in a soccer-specific 1 min drill and 15 min treadmill protocol extracted from the literature. Through individualized fitting on a 10-repetition 80 m sprint test for a soccer player, the model exhibited R<sup>2</sup> scores between 0.62 and 0.80. Furthermore, when tested with actual soccer match data, it maintained a robust performance, with the average R<sup>2</sup> scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.72. The proposed approach holds the potential to advance the understanding of tactical decisions by correlating them with real-time physical performance, offering opportunities for more informed strategies and ultimately enhancing team performance.">

										title="<strong>A Sensor-Fusion-Based Experimental Apparatus for Collecting Touchscreen Handwriting Biometric Features</strong><br/><br/>
												Using biometric data for user authentication is a frequently addressed subject within the context of computer security. Despite significant advancements in technology, handwriting analysis continues to be the most common method of identifying individuals. There are two distinct types of handwriting recognition: offline and online. The first type involves the identification and interpretation of handwritten content obtained from an image, such as digitized human handwriting. The latter pertains to the identification of handwriting derived from digital writing performed on a touchpad or touchscreen. This research paper provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed apparatus specifically developed for collecting handwritten data. The acquisition of biometric information is conducted using a touchscreen device equipped with a variety of integrated and external sensors. In addition to acquiring signatures, the sensor-fusion-based configuration accumulates handwritten phrases, words, and individual letters to facilitate online user authentication. The proposed system can collect an extensive array of data. Specifically, it is possible to capture data related to stylus pressure, magnetometer readings, images, videos, and audio signals associated with handwriting executed on a tablet device. The study incorporates instances of gathered records, providing a graphical representation of the variation in handwriting among distinct users. The data obtained were additionally analyzed with regard to inter-person variability, intra-person variability, and classification potential. Initial findings from a limited sample of users demonstrate favorable results, intending to gather data from a more extensive user base.">

										title="<strong>Development of an Agile Blended Learning Framework for Engineering Higher Educational Instutions post  Covid-19.</strong><br/><br/>
										The incessant demand for the use of online tools in education and industry may strain the resiliency of Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in terms of resource availability, employment; and assurance of access. These factors, combined with the need for HEIs to be agile in adapting to the new normality, are worth investigating following Covid-19. This entails comprehending the influence of the pandemic on the learning experience and the relevance of blended learning (BL) during Covid-19. This research work contributes a framework (ABL-HEIs) focusing on the agility, resilience, and readiness of HEIs to adopt BL in a post-Covid dynamic, adopting a case study of Faculties of Engineering in six European universities. The framework contributes a knowledge transfer roadmap through which an ABL-Resilience Index can be pursued. The majority of universities involved showed higher agility in the first year of the pandemic (2019-2020). In Phase 2 (2020-2021) most of the universities showed a similar level of resilience present between the universities.">

										title="<strong>Automated Online Assessment and Cloud-Based Programming: Advancing Computer Engineering Education</strong><br/><br/>
												Traditional teaching and learning methods in the field of Computer Engineering (CE) pose considerable obstacles for students and teachers in basic courses. These challenges are evident in programming projects, database-related tasks, or operating system-based assignments, as students often face delayed assessment and feedback. In addition, teachers must evaluate a range of submitted solutions while coping with the pen-and-paper context, subjective biases, fatigue, and lack of time. However, the undergraduate CE program at our institution has been purposefully redesigned by integrating specific software solutions into core courses. Using an automated online assessment system and a cloud-based programming platform, we have significantly improved the CE educational landscape and overcome the barriers of delayed feedback, biased evaluations, and complex development environment setups. We present two case studies demonstrating how the Online Judge and Google Colab tools have transformed the delivery of several key subjects, which may serve as motivation or an example to others looking to do the same.">

										title="<strong>Exploring the Impact of the Perceived Cognitive Load on the Physical Performance in Soccer</strong><br/><br/>
												The impact of an increased cognitive load (CL) on the players performance, encompassing tactical
												and technical aspects, is well-documented, yet its impact on the physical performance remains uncertain. Unlike
												prior research focusing on controlled settings, our study uses GPS wearable sensors and the NASA-TLX
												questionnaire to assess the physical and cognitive relationship during the national championship final round.
												The collected data serves a dual purpose: firstly, to quantify the overall perceived CL by averaging the
												NASA-TLX components and calculating the Z-scores for individual players, and secondly, to investigate the
												feasibility of constructing cognitive clusters based on positive and negative motivation profiles derived from the
												questionnaire responses. Data analysis reveals a significant difference between the low and moderate CL clusters
												in terms of the total distance (TD), high-speed running distance (HSR), and deceleration (DEC) parameters.
												Further differences are observed between the moderate and high CL clusters for TD and distance per minute
												(DPM) metrics. To refine our understanding, the players are systematically categorized into positive-aided and
												negative-aided motivation categories using the K-means clustering. The resulting clusters exhibit a strong F1
												score of 0.8696 closely aligning with the coach evaluations. However, no significant differences are observed
												between the motivation groups and physical performance. The findings underscore the adverse impact of CL on
												the soccer players physical performance.">

										title="<strong>Blended learning in the engineering field: A systematic literature review</strong><br/><br/>
												Blended Learning (BL) is defined as a combination of face-to-face and digital activities that, in recent years, has been adopted more and more frequently by Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs). In the engineering field, the adoption of BL allows creating challenging situations for students with industry-like problems to foster the acquisition of advanced problem-solving skills. Thus, it can be used to enhance traditional learning by enriching it with new aspects, allowing to update the Intended Learning Outcomes traditionally defined by teachers. Although prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) teachers had the time to prepare and programme the transition to BL, during the pandemic they had to abruptly move to the full digital delivery of the content, requiring technological and organizational adaptation, as well as change in the content teaching and assessment methods. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to understand how BL has been implemented in the engineering field by HEIs, discussing if and how the learning expectations of teachers (evaluated through Bloom's Taxonomy) change when using different mixes of face-to-face and digital activities and when the target audience changes. More specifically, the investigation addresses how content and learning expectations are split and set in face-to-face and digital settings. Additionally, the interest is towards understanding how COVID-19 impacted the adoption of BL, not only during the pandemic but also after.">

										title="<strong>Development of a Building Simulation Model for Indoor Temperature Prediction and HVAC System Anomaly Detection</strong><br/><br/>
												In order to reduce global energy consumption, energy-efficient, green and smart buildings have to be built. In addition to the application of other energy efficiency measures, an effective management of HVAC systems is required. High quality management and control of these systems ensures optimal occupant comfort levels, proper operation, rational energy consumption, and a positive impact on the environment. This is especially important for large buildings with complex systems such as hotels. As a contribution to the creation of appropriate tools for the management and control of HVAC systems in smart buildings, this paper presents the results of the current development of a detailed dynamic simulation model based on data collected from a smart room system in a hotel in Zagreb, Croatia. The smart room system, which is integrated into the hotel's building management system, provides historical data on set and current room temperatures, room occupancy schedule, window opening, fan coil operation status, fan rotation speed, valve opening, and operating mode with a time step of 5 minutes. The simulation model based on the TRNSYS software uses a part of the available data and calculates the current internal room temperatures. A comparison of the predicted and measured temperatures at each time step showed that the deviations are within the acceptable limits. The final objectives of the model development are the identification of anomalies in the operation of the HVAC system and the optimization of its operation with the aim of reducing energy consumption.">

										title="<strong>Random Forests Model for HVAC System Fault Detection in Hotel Buildings</strong><br/><br/>
												Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are essential for maintaining a comfortable indoor environment in modern buildings. However, HVAC systems are known to consume a lot of energy, which can account for up to 50% of a building’s energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to detect and troubleshoot problems in HVAC systems timely. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques can help with HVAC monitoring and optimizing system performance for efficient use of energy. In this paper, we demonstrate how to create efficient fault detectors using physics-based modeling and machine learning. We show how to build a simulation model of a hotel building, which we then use to sample augmented data with typical faults commonly found in HVAC systems. We train predictive models using random forests (RFs). The results suggest that RFs can be used as stand-alone detectors for FDD, albeit their performance depends heavily on the data quality.">

										title="<strong>Data-driven Model for Indoor Temperature Prediction in HVAC-Supported Buildings</strong><br/><br/>
												Increasing energy demand is an important issue due to limited resources and environmental concerns. Buildings are responsible for a large portion of total energy consumption, with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems being the largest consumer. With the advent of internet of things (IoT) technology, a large amount of data can be collected from buildings, providing insights into the operation of HVAC systems. This data can be employed with data-driven methods to improve efficiency, analyze performance, and develop models that represent system behavior. In this study, a data-driven artificial neural network model for predicting indoor temperatures in commercial buildings is presented. The data preprocessing procedure is described and the main features used to build the model are identified. The results show that the data-driven model can predict indoor temperatures with an intraday root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.85 °C. The developed model has the potential to be integrated into a predictive control system as a possible solution to reduce energy consumption.">

												In this paper, we empirically investigate the performance of trajectory tracing on mobile touchscreen devices. Our main goal is to compare three different tracing modalities, two of which rely on direct touch (finger and stylus) and one on indirect interaction (mouse). We conducted an experiment involving 25 users and a specially designed mobile application for managing trajectory tracing tasks and touch events logging. We describe the outcomes of this empirical study, with particular emphasis on tracing time and tracing error on a touchscreen tablet. In addition, we also discuss the associated interaction workload, specifically targeting the physical demand, perceived performance and effort, and level of frustration when using different ways to trace the given path. Finally, we show how the obtained data can be used to develop predictive models for trajectory tracing time.">

										title="<strong>Improving the Efficiency of Fan Coil Units in Hotel Buildings through Deep-Learning-Based Fault Detection</strong><br/><br/>
												Optimizing the performance of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is critical in today’s energy-conscious world. Fan coil units (FCUs) play a critical role in providing comfort in various environments as an important component of HVAC systems. However, FCUs often experience failures that affect their efficiency and increase their energy consumption. In this context, deep learning (DL)-based fault detection offers a promising solution. By detecting faults early and preventing system failures, the efficiency of FCUs can be improved. This paper explores DL models as fault detectors for FCUs to enable smarter and more energy-efficient hotel buildings. We tested three contemporary DL modeling approaches: convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and a combination of CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The random forest model (RF) was additionally developed as a baseline benchmark. The fault detectors were tested on a real-world dataset obtained from the sensory measurement system installed in a hotel and additionally supplemented with simulated data via a physical model developed in TRNSYS. Three representative FCU faults, namely, a stuck valve, a reduction in airflow, and an FCU outage, were simulated with a much larger dataset than is typically utilized in similar studies. The results showed that the hybrid model, integrating CNN and GRU, performed best for all three observed faults. DL-based fault detectors outperformed the baseline RF model, confirming these solutions as viable components for energy-efficient hotels.">

										title="<strong>Generating Representative Phrase Sets for Text Entry Experiments by GA-Based Text Corpora Sampling</strong><br/><br/>
												In the field of human–computer interaction (HCI), text entry methods can be evaluated through controlled user experiments or predictive modeling techniques. While the modeling approach requires a language model, the empirical approach necessitates representative text phrases for the experimental stimuli. In this context, finding a phrase set with the best language representativeness belongs to the class of optimization problems in which a solution is sought in a large search space. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-based method for extracting a target phrase set from the available text corpus, optimizing its language representativeness. Kullback–Leibler divergence is utilized to evaluate candidates, considering the digram probability distributions of both the source corpus and the target sample. The proposed method is highly customizable, outperforms typical random sampling, and exhibits language independence. The representative phrase sets generated by the proposed solution facilitate a more valid comparison of the results from different text entry studies. The open source implementation enables the easy customization of the GA-based sampling method, promotes its immediate utilization, and facilitates the reproducibility of this study. In addition, we provide heuristic guidelines for preparing the text entry experiments, which consider the experiment’s intended design and the phrase set to be generated with the proposed solution.">

										title="<strong>Development, Calibration, and Validation of a Simulation Model for Indoor Temperature Prediction and HVAC System Fault Detection</strong><br/><br/>
												An effective approach to increasing energy efficiency in buildings without compromising thermal comfort is to optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems through the use of advanced building-management system features, such as fault detection and diagnosis. Such functions are usually developed based on simulation models that must be calibrated and validated to achieve an appropriate level of accuracy and reliability. The objective of this study was to develop and calibrate a room-level simulation model of a hotel building and its HVAC system using TRNSYS 18 software and real data collected from the smart room system installed in the building. The calibration process was performed with 100 rooms using 5-min samples of room temperatures in selected 1-month periods during the summer and winter seasons by minimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the average of the observed rooms using a genetic algorithm. The calibrated model was able to predict room temperatures with an RMSE of 0.79 ± 0.14 °C and a coefficient of variation in the root mean squared error (cvRMSE) of 3.58 ± 0.7%, which is well below the limits prescribed by international guidelines. The model was then applied to detect faults in the operation of fan coil units in the rooms based on the residual analysis and defined if–then rules. The results obtained show that the model can track the trends of temperature changes in real conditions and successfully detect major anomalies in a system.">

												Motor imagery (MI) is a technique of imagining the performance of a motor task without actually using the muscles. When employed in a brain–computer interface (BCI) supported by electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors, it can be used as a successful method of human–computer interaction. In this paper, the performance of six different classifiers, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and three classifiers from the family of convolutional neural networks (CNN), is evaluated using EEG MI datasets. The study investigates the effectiveness of these classifiers on MI, guided by a static visual cue, dynamic visual guidance, and a combination of dynamic visual and vibrotactile (somatosensory) guidance. The effect of filtering passband during data preprocessing was also investigated. The results show that the ResNet-based CNN significantly outperforms the competing classifiers on both vibrotactile and visually guided data when detecting different directions of MI. Preprocessing the data using low-frequency signal features proves to be a better solution to achieve higher classification accuracy. It has also been shown that vibrotactile guidance has a significant impact on classification accuracy, with the associated improvement particularly evident for architecturally simpler classifiers. These findings have important implications for the development of EEG-based BCIs, as they provide valuable insight into the suitability of different classifiers for different contexts of use.">

										title="<strong>A Review of Data-Driven Approaches and Techniques for Fault Detection and Diagnosis in HVAC Systems</strong><br/><br/>
												Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are a popular research topic because buildings’ energy is mostly used for heating and/or cooling. These systems heavily rely on sensory measurements and typically make an integral part of the smart building concept. As such, they require the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methodologies, which should assist users in maintaining comfort while consuming minimal energy. Despite the fact that FDD approaches are a well-researched subject, not just for improving the operation of HVAC systems but also for a wider range of systems in industrial processes, there is a lack of application in commercial buildings due to their complexity and low transferability. The aim of this review paper is to present and systematize cutting-edge FDD methodologies, encompassing approaches and special techniques that can be applied in HVAC systems, as well as to provide best-practice heuristics for researchers and solution developers in this domain. While the literature analysis targets the FDD perspective, the main focus is put on the data-driven approach, which covers commonly used models and data pre-processing techniques in the field. Data-driven techniques and FDD solutions based on them, which are most commonly used in recent HVAC research, form the backbone of our study, while alternative FDD approaches are also presented and classified to properly contextualize and round out the review.">

										title="<strong>Data Visualization Tool for Smart Buildings HVAC Systems</strong><br/><br/>
												With the expected increase in world population and economic growth, the demand for energy is steadily increasing worldwide. To support the growing exploitation of energy resources, buildings must be made smart enough to use energy efficiently without wasting it. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume a lot of energy and hence require effective control and analysis capabilities, which is one of the most important aspects of current smart buildings. If HVAC systems are not properly controlled, this can lead to poor user comfort, high utility bills due to excessive energy consumption, and a negative impact on the environment. This problem is aggravated in the context of hotel buildings. To support the overall energy consumption tracking, we propose a system integration with an analytical web application for data visualization that allows the user to perform an in-depth analysis of the sensory data measured. The motivation for developing the application is primarily to monitor the regulation of the HVAC system by providing an interactive analytical dashboard needed for future smart buildings. The data visualization tool provides a quick and easy way to visualize and compare time-series data. The visualizations provide insight into how different hotel rooms compare, deviations of room temperature from setpoint temperature, data distribution, correlations between sensory data parameters, and the degree of correlation of room temperature compared to other parameters. The application is aimed at a wide range of users, from lay people and hotel staff to data analysts and scientists conducting research in this area.">

												In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept for text entry technique that requires no direct contact with the mobile device and relies exclusively on built-in light sensor utilization. Simple in-air gestures, performed above the smartphone screen, alter the current level of ambient lighting. This allows adjusting the keyboard cursor position based on the sensor readings. The idea of this work is in accordance with the Around-Device Interaction (ADI) concept, currently attracting a lot of attention in the Human-Computer Interaction field. The proposed solution successfully augments an input area of a mobile device without the use of sophisticated peripherals. Two different methods can be used to select the target character, depending on how the keyboard cursor is operated. While manual control requires continuous hand gestures to directly adjust the cursor position, automatic control is based on stopping the cursor along its predefined route. In the conducted experiment, 32 participants utilized the touchless interaction technique for both text entry methods on their own smartphone devices. The outcomes of this empirical research are reported, with a special emphasis on text entry speed, total error rate, usability attributes, and perceived workload.">

The service itself is designed as a floating widget that can be attached to the target mobile application, thus augmenting it with Around Device Interaction (ADI) support.

												In this paper, we investigate the possibilities for augmenting interaction around the mobile device, with the aim of enabling input techniques that do not rely on typical touch-based gestures. The presented research focuses on utilizing a built-in magnetic field sensor, whose readouts are intentionally affected by moving a strong permanent magnet around a smartphone device. Different approaches for supporting magnet-based Around-Device Interaction are applied, including magnetic field fingerprinting, curve-fitting modeling, and machine learning. We implemented the corresponding proof-of-concept applications that incorporate magnet-based interaction. Namely, text entry is achieved by discrete positioning of the magnet within a keyboard mockup, and free-move pointing is enabled by monitoring the magnet’s continuous movement in real-time. The related solutions successfully expand both the interaction language and the interaction space in front of the device without altering its hardware or involving sophisticated peripherals. A controlled experiment was conducted to evaluate the provided text entry method initially. The obtained results were promising (text entry speed of nine words per minute) and served as a motivation for implementing new interaction modalities. The use of neural networks has shown to be a better approach than curve fitting to support free-move pointing. We demonstrate how neural networks with a very small number of input parameters can be used to provide highly usable pointing with an acceptable level of error (mean absolute error of 3 mm for pointer position on the smartphone display).">

												In this paper we present and analyze pie-menu implementation for touchscreen mobile devices which supports swipe-based navigation through deep hierarchical menu configurations. We propose a solution that synergistically encompasses important design features for a given context: radial menu visualization, semi-transparency, manual repositioning, occlusion awareness, and marking menu concept. From the menu navigation efficiency standpoint, dwell time represents one of the most influential factors in such a design. Reducing the time needed to automatically activate submenus could potentially provide faster navigation through the pie-menu hierarchy ; however, short dwell times could make swipe-based interaction more error-prone, as unintentional item selections are then more probable. Therefore, we specifically investigate the effect of dwell time on navigation efficiency when using the proposed solution. A remotely administered experiment involving 36 participants was carried out in order to empirically evaluate different dwell time values. The interaction style, i.e. the way of holding a smartphone device, was also taken into account as an independent variable. We present the results of this empirical research, additionally tackling the interaction workload, usability attributes, and overall design considerations of the proposed solution. According to the obtained results, we argue that highly adaptable pie-menus could provide interaction benefits in the mobile touchscreen domain.">

										title="<strong>Indoor Localization Based on Infrared Angle of Arrival Sensor Network</strong><br/><br/>
												Accurate, inexpensive, and reliable real-time indoor localization holds the key to the full potential of the context-aware applications and location-based Internet of Things (IoT) services. State-of-the-art indoor localization systems are coping with the complex non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation which hinders the use of proven multiangulation and multilateration methods, as well as with prohibitive installation costs, computational demands, and energy requirements. In this paper, we present a novel sensor utilizing low-range infrared (IR) signal in the line-of-sight (LOS) context providing high precision angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation. The proposed sensor is used in the pragmatic solution to the localization problem that avoids NLOS propagation issues by exploiting the powerful concept of the wireless sensor network (WSN). To demonstrate the proposed solution, we applied it in the challenging context of the supermarket cart navigation. In this specific use case, a proof-of-concept navigation system was implemented with the following components: IR-AoA sensor prototype and the corresponding WSN used for cart localization, server-side application programming interface (API), and client application suite consisting of smartphone and smartwatch applications. The localization performance of the proposed solution was assessed in, altogether, four evaluation procedures, including both empirical and simulation settings. The evaluation outcomes are ranging from centimeter-level accuracy achieved in static-1D context up to 1 m mean localization error obtained for a mobile cart moving at 140 cm/s in a 2D setup. These results show that, for the supermarket context, appropriate localization accuracy can be achieved, along with the real-time navigation support, using readily available IR technology with inexpensive hardware components.">

										title="<strong>Floating Hierarchical Menus for Swipe-Based Navigation on Touchscreen Mobile Devices</strong><br/><br/>
												In this paper, we present two menu implementations that allow swipe-based navigation through deep hierarchical menu configurations. Instead of utilizing repetitive tap-based selections, the proposed interaction relies on continuous finger movement across different submenus. The menus are implemented as a service; hence they can easily be attached to the target mobile application and visualized as a semi-transparent floating widget on top of it. Similar to the marking menu concept, the provided designs also enable a smooth transition from novice to expert user, as swipe gestures used for menu item selections can be memorized and subsequently executed faster. Both menus initially act as a floating action button, allowing the user to change its location by dragging it to the preferred place on the screen. Visualization of the menu starts in this pivotal position, according to the utilized design: Tile menu or Pie menu. The Tile menu uses a linear scheme and dynamically occupies more screen real-estate when a submenu is triggered. On the other hand, the Pie menu is displayed as a circular widget without extra containers and uses touch-dwelling for submenu invocation. Implementations of the proposed menu designs are evaluated and comparatively analyzed by conducting a controlled experiment involving 30 participants. We present the results of this empirical research, specifically focusing on menu navigation efficiency in two different contexts of use, the related interaction workload, and usability attributes.">

The data contains Waveform Audio File format (WAV) files, capturing every possible distinct tone of both <i>sopele</i>, as well as their polyphonic combinations. Additional data encompassed in the provided dataset are music scales and real music pieces, which contain specific traditional melodies. Every melody has a corresponding music sheet, presented in a Portable Document Format (PDF) file, which describes it in a human-readable manner. The specific Istrian scale music notation was applied while creating the music sheets. The data presented here was successfully utilised for developing, training and testing an automatic music transcription (AMT) solution, capable of converting <i>sopele</i> audio recordings into musical scores.">

										title="<strong>Automatic Music Transcription for Traditional Woodwind Instruments <i>Sopele</i></strong><br/><br/>
												<i>Sopela</i> is a traditional hand-made woodwind instrument, commonly played in pair, characteristic to the Istrian peninsula in western Croatia. Its piercing sound, accompanied by two-part singing in the hexatonic Istrian scale, is registered in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This paper presents an insight study of automatic music transcription (AMT) for <i>sopele</i> tunes. The process of converting audio inputs into human-readable musical scores involves multi-pitch detection and note tracking. The proposed solution supports this process by utilising frequency-feature extraction, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, and postprocessing heuristics. We determined the most favourable tone-predicting model by applying grid search for two state-of-the-art ML techniques, optionally coupled with frequency-feature extraction. The model achieved promising transcription accuracy for both monophonic and polyphonic music sources encompassed in the originally developed dataset. In addition, we developed a proof-of-concept AMT system, comprised of a client mobile application and a server-side API. While the mobile application records, tags and uploads audio sources, the back-end server applies the presented procedure for converting recorded music into a common notation to be delivered as a transcription result. We thus demonstrate how collecting and preserving traditional <i>sopele</i> music, performed in real-life occasions, can be effortlessly accomplished on-the-go.">

										title="<strong>Contact-free Interaction with Mobile Devices using Magnetic, Lighting and Infrared Sources</strong><br/><br/>
												In the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the concept of Around Device Interaction (ADI) is gaining special attention nowadays. It provides the possibility of interacting with the device by making use of gestures made in the surrounding space, as well as by detecting certain ambient changes, thus eliminating the need of direct physical contact. Contact-free interaction can be useful for wearable and smart devices, especially in cases where operating with small buttons and touchscreens appears to be particularly inconvenient. This paper presents alternative techniques for smartphone interaction based on different sensory inputs. Namely, external sources of magnetic field, light, and infrared (IR) signals are used to manipulate device sensors' readings which are in turn interpreted as the corresponding interaction commands. Proof-of-concept mobile applications are developed and here presented, demonstrating both the potentials and utility of the contact-free interaction. Specifically, small neodymium magnet was used for smartphone text entry, typical battery flashlight served for sending information to device via Morse code, as well as for alarm triggering, and voice-enabled control device was utilized for invoking smartphone calls from a distance. The presented interaction techniques do not require smartphone hardware alterations. While the usage of built-in magnetic field and ambient light sensors is assumed, peripheral infrared receiver can be used in order to provide IR-based support.">

												This paper presents a highly customizable assistive on-screen keyboard for mobile devices, which supports several text entry methods based on row-column and bisection scanning techniques. Text entry can be accomplished using a zone based touch screen interface and/or via hardware keypads, involving configurable input control which can range from single-switch solution up to 5-key design. Apart from the presentation of a novel user interface, the paper contributions are as follows: development of movement models for all scan-based methods involved in text entry solution, computation of related upper-bound text entry speed predictions, and empirical investigation of their validity. In order to assess model predictions, a specific instance of row-column scanning technique was juxtaposed to bisection scanning principle in a user study involving 16 participants. Methods are evaluated against text entry performance, required workload, and general usability attributes. Although theoretical models predicted higher entry speed for bisection scanning, the results obtained from experiment demonstrated the row-column technique as significantly more efficient. This outcome discrepancy is specifically discussed by putting emphasis on factors that affect identified relation.">

										title="<strong>Integrating Blink Click interaction into a head tracking system: implementation and usability issues</strong><br/><br/>
												In the area of human–computer interaction, contemporary head tracking systems are often used as camera-based mouse emulators. While head movement detection provides the basis for related mouse shifting and positioning, standard click actions are usually emulated using stillness counter techniques such as Dwell Click (DC). However, these techniques can be a source of enlarged interaction burden, as users often have to struggle with time-consuming repetitive UI actions. This paper proposes a novel version of Blink Click (BC) action called B2C, based on double eye blink detection, as a valuable supplement for faster mouse click emulation. The integration of the proposed BC action into an existing head tracking system is presented, and implementation issues are thoroughly analyzed. Usability testing of the proposed B2C interaction model, along with the already embedded DC model, has been carried out, providing both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. The results show efficiency improvement as well as a higher level of users’ satisfaction when using the proposed version of BC, thus making it a strong candidate to become a standard feature within the computer-vision-based mouse emulation.">

									title="<strong>Predicting upper-bound text entry speeds for discrete-tilt-based input on smartphones</strong><br/><br/>
											Motion sensors integrated into contemporary smartphones allow the introduction of new mobile interaction paradigms, here including tilt-based input control in the mobile context. Namely, as opposed to existing implementations that typically apply continuous feedback on tilting, we define Pitch and Roll movement sequences that change the orientation of the mobile device as discrete-tilt input primitives. The respective commands are then used to manage text entry within three discrete-tilt-based methods thus introduced: keyboard bisection, single cursor, and quad cursor. Each method is based on the use of a particular QWERTY-based keyboard layout with related strategy for character input. We model upper-bound text entry speeds for the input methods, taking into account both movement aspects and language context. The movement model corresponds to both the tilt-based shortest path between two consequent characters, which is theoretically defined, and the time of discrete-tilt execution, which is obtained from user testing experiment we conducted. The linguistic model, comprising digraph statistics, is constructed basing on available English corpora. This modeling approach provides discrete-tilt-based text entry speed predictions representing efficiency rates for expert behavior, i.e. for optimal performance. The results obtained enable the evaluation of the proposed designs without need to test with real users, and can furthermore serve as a baseline for efficiency of text entry implementations that rely on discrete tilt.">

											In this paper we investigate text entry performance for mobile touchscreen devices with emulated QWERTY keyboards, with special emphasis on interaction style and screen size. When addressing interaction style, we are referring to the five most common combinations of hands postures and device orientations while executing text entry tasks. Both single-finger and two-thumb methods for typing in portrait and/or landscape layout are considered. As for screen sizes, several classes of popular mobile devices are examined, specifically smartphones and tablets with smaller and larger form factor. In addition, the mobile device emulator is included in the study, in order to report the comparative analysis of text entry with an actual device and its emulation-based counterpart. The touchscreen desktop monitor was used so as to provide touch input for the device emulator.

									title="<strong>Measuring the Effect of First Encounter with Source Code Entry for Instruction Set Architectures Using Touchscreen Devices: Evaluation of Usability Components</strong><br/><br/>
											In this paper we address the possibility of writing program code for instruction set architectures using the touchscreen as the input device. Instruction set architecture is the common name for a collection of resources computer engineers use when developing code at the hardware level. One of the most important subsets among these resources are instructions which programmers use to create algorithms. Students enrolled in computer engineering curricula are trained to develop such solutions, using standard personal computers equipped with keyboard and mouse, thus providing them with a high level usability working environment. As technology progress has enabled the introduction of mobile platforms in the educational process, touchscreen based m-learning becomes a viable tool. To that end, in our previous research we developed a specific keyboard VMK that supports entry of assembly language code, which is based on mnemonic keys, with the aim to achieve a better efficiency of assembly coding. In the present paper we present the outcome of an improved empirical research targeting the comparison of VMK and the standard QWERTY keyboard. The results thus obtained show improved results of key usability attributes of efficiency and subjective satisfaction.">

The prototype implementation of the proposed interaction method is analyzed and evaluated via usability testing experiments, with special focus on efficiency of text entry.

Beside personal motivation and discipline, there are objective factors which limit the amount of available laboratory time for students. To deal with the afore mentioned problem for electrical engineering and computer science courses teaching basic concepts of computer architecture at the undergraduate level, we have devised a pocket-size prototyping system which can be controlled from any kind of computer device, here including contemporary mobile phones and tablets. The issue which we tackle in this paper is the efficient use of touchscreen devices to input assembly language code controlling the operation of the main processing unit on the prototyping system. The results of the pilot study performed, which addresses accuracy and time needed to accomplish the task, are rather encouraging, and shows that our special variant of virtual keyboard did not deteriorate students' performance when inputting assembly code.">

However, there are no formal specifications, nor design guidelines concerning usability and overall user experience. In this paper, we reveal a number of UI usability issues in existing client applications that represent the source of enlarged interaction burden and user displeasure when working with client software. Furthermore, we propose a UI lightweight prototype model, based on both conducted investigation and well known usability guidelines, adding the value of its potentiality for usage in the mobile domain.

											Present day mobile applications are becoming increasingly pervasive and complex, involving sophisticated user interfaces and touchscreen-based interaction designs. Their overall acceptance is highly dependent on usability, hence there exists a strong need to make related usability issues an integral part of the mobile software development. In this paper we propose a touchscreen meta-testing model, a set of individual test cases which represents what we believe to be the basic aspects of usability, common to all touchscreen applications. The main goal of the meta-test is to provide relevant feedback on elementary mobile touchscreen interaction, and to use obtained results as important parameters and usability guidelines within the mobile software development process. Along with universal usability support for touchscreen mobile applications in general, this experimental framework can provide some additional benefits, related to different possible ways of both applying meta-test model and using its final outcomes.">

In this paper we propose a model interaction benchmark test providing both quantitative and qualitative usability feedback at the elementary touchscreen action level.">

									title="<strong>On Efficiency of Adaptation Algorithms for Mobile Interfaces Navigation</strong><br/><br/>
											Many ubiquitous computing systems and applications, including mobile learning ones, can make use of personalization procedures in order to support and improve universal usability. In our previous work, we have created a GUI menu model for mobile device applications, where personalization capabilities are primarily derived from the use of adaptable and adaptive techniques. In this paper we analyze from a theoretical point of view the efficiency of the two adaptation approaches and related algorithms. A task simulation framework has been developed for comparison of static and automatically adapted menus in the mobile application environment. Algorithm functionality is evaluated according to adaptivity effects provided in various menu configurations and within several classes of randomly generated navigation tasks. Simulation results thus obtained support the usage of adaptivity, which provides a valuable improvement in navigation efficiency within menu-based mobile interfaces.">

									title="<strong>Digital Design Mobile Virtual Laboratory Implementation: A Pragmatic Approach</strong><br/><br/>
											The omnipresence of m-devices, and especially those of the cellular phones type, certainly makes the basis for the introduction and use of m-learning systems, but their implementation heavily depends on the area to be covered hence showing a different degree of complexity. This especially holds for the area of digital design, where there is the need for handling logic schemes which includes both displaying and modifying them in addition to the usual imaging of text and graphics. In this paper we discuss essential HCI issues, which are related to the implementation of a Mobile Virtual Laboratory for digital logic design. We make use of a pragmatic approach by blending a number of interaction methods known from other application fields hopefully providing a holistic effect in the process of learning and teaching in the mobile.">

									title="<strong>Transformable Menu Component for Mobile Device Applications: Working with both Adaptive and Adaptable User Interfaces</strong><br/><br/>
											Using a learning system in a mobile environment is not effective if barriers are not overcome in the interaction with targeted users. For that purpose all mobile services, including m-learning ones, demand special attention being paid to interaction with the user. While mobile device applications are becoming more powerful, their development process must utilize the concepts of universal access and universal usability. This paper describes the model of both adaptable and adaptive mobile user interface, through the introduction of a transformable menu component capable to be personalized to each individual user with respect to her/his preferences and interaction style. We discuss the use of customization and adaptation techniques, with the aim to both enhance mobile HCI and to increase user satisfaction, particularly when working with graphically rich m-learning applications.">

									title="<strong>A Holistic Approach to Enhance Universal Usability in m-Learning</strong><br/><br/>
											In the comprehensive process of lifetime learning, the introduction of m-learning systems, services and applications represents one of the main challenges in the area of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp). With the rapid development of mobile devices, the widespread provision of connectivity, as well as well-modeled learning services, all presumptions for effective m-learning implementations are fulfilled. The acceptance of such systems is however highly dependent on usability, implying particular emphasis on the design of both application user interfaces and interaction. In this paper we discuss a holistic approach to personalization of mobile human-computer interaction, targeting the improvement of the overall user experience. Within this context we analyze the possibilities for m-learning application adjustment regarding mobile device capabilities, student domain knowledge level, and interaction style and skills. Personalization issues are explained along with the respective functional models, with special focus on the menu component model, which is transformable according to users' navigation patterns.">

									title="<strong>Mobile Virtual Laboratory: Learning Digital Design</strong><br/><br/>
											An important part of learning digital design is the acquisition of knowledge through working experience in a laboratory environment, what will corroborate theoretical knowledge exposed elsewhere (e.g. in lectures, through written exercise solving etc.). This paper describes the foundation of a virtual laboratory available to every student at any moment and regardless of her/his whereabouts, following the concepts of universal access. We discuss the main issues in running a digital design lab, the essentials of contemporary mobile technology and the possible solutions to merge the two with the final objective being the development of a multiplatform system able to run both on (desktop) PCs and on mobile devices (terminals). We also discuss issues in the supporting HCI, especially in making the interaction as simple as possible.">
